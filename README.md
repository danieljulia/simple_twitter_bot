# twitter_bot
Very simple twitter bot


This is a php based twitter bot in a single script
The script searches for a word or hashtag and when it finds it publishes a twitt using the user_name of the twitt, optionally it follows the user.
Should be called in a cron task every 30min
No database required. If it's called every 30min, it only searches for twitts in this period.

The comments are in spanish, sorry,
